Times between 100-200ms are acceptable for most applications but may cause noticeable lag in real-time applications like gaming or video conferencing. Anything above 200ms indicates potential network issues. Packet loss above 1% suggests network problems that need investigation. Consistent ping times indicate stable connections, while highly variable times suggest network congestion or routing issues."

Ports are virtual endpoints for network communication, with each port number (1-65535) potentially hosting different services. Common ports include 80 for HTTP web traffic, 443 for HTTPS, 22 for SSH, and 25 for email.

System administrators verify that services are accessible on their intended ports after configuration changes. Security professionals scan for open ports to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure unnecessary ports are closed.

Network troubleshooters use port checking to diagnose why services aren't accessible, determining if the issue is with the service itself, firewall rules, or network routing.",
