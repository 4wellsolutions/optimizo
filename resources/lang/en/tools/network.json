            "q2": "What are the different types of DNS records?",
            "a2": "Common DNS record types include A (IPv4 address), AAAA (IPv6 address), MX (mail server), CNAME (alias), TXT (text data), NS (name server), and SOA (start of authority). Each record type serves a specific purpose in domain configuration.",
            "q3": "How long does DNS propagation take?",
            "a3": "DNS propagation typically takes 24-48 hours globally, though changes can appear within minutes on some servers. The time depends on TTL (Time To Live) settings and how quickly DNS servers refresh their cache.",
            "q4": "Why is my DNS lookup failing?",
            "a4": "DNS lookup failures can occur due to incorrect domain name, DNS server issues, firewall blocking, or the domain not being properly configured. Check your domain spelling and ensure your DNS records are correctly set up.",
            "q5": "Can I lookup DNS records for any domain?",

            "a2": "IP geolocation is typically accurate at the country level (95-99%) and city level (50-75%). Accuracy varies based on the IP database and how ISPs manage their IP blocks. VPNs and proxies can mask the true location.",

            "a2": "For general browsing: under 100ms is good. For gaming: under 50ms is ideal, under 20ms is excellent. For video calls: under 150ms is acceptable. Lower ping means faster response times.",
            "q3": "Why is my ping high?",
            "a3": "High ping can be caused by network congestion, distance to server, poor WiFi signal, ISP throttling, or too many devices on your network. Try using wired connection, closing bandwidth-heavy applications, or contacting your ISP.",
