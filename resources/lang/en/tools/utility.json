            "faq": {
                "q1": "How secure are the passwords generated by this tool?",
                "a1": "Our password generator uses cryptographically secure random number generation to create passwords. The passwords are generated entirely in your browser using JavaScript's crypto.getRandomValues() method, ensuring true randomness and maximum security. We never store, transmit, or log any generated passwords.",
                "q2": "What is the ideal password length?",
                "a2": "We recommend a minimum of 16 characters for strong security. Longer passwords (24-32 characters) provide even better protection against brute-force attacks. Our generator supports up to 64 characters for maximum security.",
                "q3": "Should I include special characters in my password?",
                "a3": "Yes, absolutely! Including special characters (!@#$%^&*) significantly increases password complexity and entropy. A password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols is exponentially harder to crack than one with just letters and numbers.",
                "q4": "How do I remember complex passwords?",
                "a4": "Don't try to memorize them! Use a reputable password manager like LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden, or Dashlane to securely store all your passwords. Password managers encrypt your passwords and only require you to remember one master password.",
                "q5": "Is it safe to use an online password generator?",
                "a5": "Yes, our password generator is completely safe because all password generation happens locally in your browser. The passwords are never sent to our servers or stored anywhere.",
                "q6": "How often should I change my passwords?",
                "a6": "For critical accounts (email, banking, work), change passwords every 3-6 months. If you suspect a breach or receive a security alert, change your password immediately."

                "p2": "The strength of a password is measured by its entropy - the amount of randomness and unpredictability. A 16-character password with all character types has significantly higher entropy than a simple 8-character password.",

                "a3": "For business cards, use at least 256px. For posters and banners, use 512px or 1024px. The larger the print size, the bigger the QR code should be for easy scanning.",
                "q4": "Can I track QR code scans?",
                "a4": "Our tool generates static QR codes without tracking. To track scans, use a URL shortener with analytics before generating the QR code, or use a dynamic QR code service.",
                "q5": "Is there a limit to how much data I can encode?",
                "a5": "QR codes can store up to 4,296 alphanumeric characters, but for best scanning results, keep data concise. URLs under 100 characters work best.",
                "q6": "Do QR codes expire?",
                "a6": "No, QR codes themselves never expire. However, if the QR code links to a URL that gets deleted or changed, the QR code won't work anymore."
