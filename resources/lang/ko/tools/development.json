                "a1": "[Pending Translation] No! Base64 is NOT encryption - it's simply encoding. Anyone can decode Base64 data instantly. Never use Base64 alone for security. For encryption, use proper cryptographic algorithms like AES, RSA, or TLS\/SSL.",
                "q2": "[Pending Translation] Why does Base64 increase file size?",
                "a2": "[Pending Translation] Base64 encoding increases data size by approximately 33% because it represents 3 bytes of binary data using 4 ASCII characters. This overhead is the trade-off for making binary data safe for text-only systems.",
                "q3": "[Pending Translation] What is Base64 used for?",
                "a3": "[Pending Translation] Base64 is used for encoding binary data (images, files, credentials) into ASCII text for transmission over text-only systems like email, URLs, JSON, XML, and HTTP headers. It's essential for API authentication, data URIs, and email attachments.",
