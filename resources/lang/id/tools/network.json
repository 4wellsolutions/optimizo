Ports are virtual endpoints for network communication, with each port number (1-65535) potentially hosting different services. Common ports include 80 for HTTP web traffic, 443 for HTTPS, 22 for SSH, and 25 for email. Checking port status is essential for network configuration, security auditing, and troubleshooting connectivity issues.",

System administrators verify that services are accessible on their intended ports after configuration changes. Security professionals scan for open ports to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure unnecessary ports are closed. Developers test whether their applications are properly listening on configured ports. Network troubleshooters use port checking to diagnose why services aren't accessible, determining if the issue is with the service itself, firewall rules, or network routing.",
