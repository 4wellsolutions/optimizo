                "q1": "[Pending Translation] How secure are the passwords generated by this tool?",
                "a1": "[Pending Translation] Our password generator uses cryptographically secure random number generation to create passwords. The passwords are generated entirely in your browser using JavaScript's crypto.getRandomValues() method, ensuring true randomness and maximum security. We never store, transmit, or log any generated passwords.",
                "q2": "[Pending Translation] What is the ideal password length?",
                "a2": "[Pending Translation] We recommend a minimum of 16 characters for strong security. Longer passwords (24-32 characters) provide even better protection against brute-force attacks. Our generator supports up to 64 characters for maximum security.",
                "q3": "[Pending Translation] Should I include special characters in my password?",
                "a3": "[Pending Translation] Yes, absolutely! Including special characters (!@#$%^&*) significantly increases password complexity and entropy. A password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols is exponentially harder to crack than one with just letters and numbers.",
                "q4": "[Pending Translation] How do I remember complex passwords?",
                "a4": "[Pending Translation] Don't try to memorize them! Use a reputable password manager like LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden, or Dashlane to securely store all your passwords. Password managers encrypt your passwords and only require you to remember one master password.",
                "q5": "[Pending Translation] Is it safe to use an online password generator?",
                "a5": "[Pending Translation] Yes, our password generator is completely safe because all password generation happens locally in your browser. The passwords are never sent to our servers or stored anywhere.",
                "q6": "[Pending Translation] How often should I change my passwords?",
                "a6": "[Pending Translation] For critical accounts (email, banking, work), change passwords every 3-6 months. If you suspect a breach or receive a security alert, change your password immediately."

                "q4": "[Pending Translation] Can I track QR code scans?",
                "a4": "[Pending Translation] Our tool generates static QR codes without tracking. To track scans, use a URL shortener with analytics before generating the QR code, or use a dynamic QR code service.",
                "q5": "[Pending Translation] Is there a limit to how much data I can encode?",
                "a5": "[Pending Translation] QR codes can store up to 4,296 alphanumeric characters, but for best scanning results, keep data concise. URLs under 100 characters work best.",
