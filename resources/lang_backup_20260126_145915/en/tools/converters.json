It's a fundamental concept in chemistry, equal to the sum of atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule. For example, water (H₂O) has a molar mass of approximately 18 g/mol (2×1 + 16). Understanding molar mass is essential for stoichiometry, solution preparation, and chemical calculations.",
            "description_p2": "The standard unit is g/mol, though kg/mol is used for larger quantities (1 kg/mol = 1000 g/mol). Imperial systems occasionally use lb/mol, where 1 lb/mol ≈ 453.59 g/mol. Carbon-12 is defined to have exactly 12 g/mol, serving as the reference for atomic mass units.
